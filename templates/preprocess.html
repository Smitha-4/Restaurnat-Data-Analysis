<div class="sub-div" id="introduction">
    <h1>Necessity of Preprocessing</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To beign with I collected Zomato Restaurants Data from
        kaggle.com and Extracted other data from Swiggy using a scraping bot. Zomato and Swiggy are popular
        apps where most of the food orders are placed on daily Basis by people in Bengaluru.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Project involes restaurants in Bengaluru.The Dataset is
        obtained by scraping the two popular online delivery systems. Swiggy and Zomato. The dataset is
        separately obtained and later combined to make it as one file. The size of the individual files are
        0.5GB and 100MB respectively from Zomato
        and Swiggy.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before combining I have cleanned individual columns for any
        null values, unrequired values in text data etcetra.
        All the code which I followed to create the new dataset are clearely shown in the following
        sections.
        <br><br><br>

    <h1>Process implemented</h1>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <Label>Step1: Importing neccesary modules and Reading raw
            data</Label>
        To clean the data, I required pandas and clean-text module. Two separate files in the csv format was
        read using pandas Dataframe <br>
        <img src="/static/images/preprocess/preprocess1.png">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <Label>Step2: Checking the columns in each set. </Label>
        Both the files have restaurants name, area in which they are located, rating, cost of dining for two
        people columns.
        Although they are categorised under different column names. I renamed the 2nd file columns to merge
        with the first file.
        Once combined, I started the cleaning process. The first file came with 17 columns and 51717 rows of
        information.
        Whereas the second file came with 7 columns and 10298 rows of information.
        <br>
        <img src="/static/images/preprocess/preprocess2.png" alt="">
        <br>File 1 had the following columns.
        <br><img src="/static/images/preprocess/preprocess3.png" alt="">
        <br>File 2 had the following columns.
        <br><img src="/static/images/preprocess/preprocess4.png" alt="">
        I merged the files.
        <br><img src="/static/images/preprocess/preprocess5.png">
        <br><br><br><br> Before cleaning I made sure the index column was fixed and the columns were renamed
        properly.
        DataFrame came with columns which did not contribute to overall analysis. They were time limited
        Offers given out by the restaurants. I retained other unrequired columns such as phone numbers, url
        and address columns as they will be come in handy in the final product. The offer is an inclusive
        thing which the restaurants decide depending on the season. I will clean rate column, votes column,
        cost column as they are numerical columns.

        <br>Another important thing is to clean categorical columns such as address, online order, book
        table, rest type, dishes liked, cuisines, review list, menu item. City column was repeated. Menu
        Item was an individual length array.
        At some time after this analysis. I would use the menu column to build a food recommending system.
        <br><img src="/static/images/preprocess/preprocess6.png">
        <br><img src="/static/images/preprocess/preprocess7.png">
        <br> <br><br><br>The categorical columns like dishes liked, cuisines, type of restaurants,
        book_table,
        online_order, came with lot of null values. I replaced respective columns with appropriate values in
        place of null values. I also filled address and phone columns with a string message. For Statistical
        analysis I did drop these unknown values and did the analysis on the rest of the available data.
        Drawing conclusions on the unknown data is difficult. Its going be purly perspective analysis if I
        try to include those values. The below picture depicts the procedure I followed to fill Null values.
        <br><img src="/static/images/preprocess/preprocess8.png">
        <br><br><br><br> Coming to the Rating of the restaurants, rating had unique values like 'NEW', '_',.
        The rating
        column which was in original zomato dataset had rating in '/5' format, meaning for example 4.5 out
        of 5, whereas the rating column in Swiggy Dataset was just a number. (for example 4.5)
        <br>To avoid this confusion, I removed '/5', and other inappropriate values. I used the following
        function to do the job. I also made sure that the rating was a float value. Rating came as a string
        type column.
        <br><img src="/static/images/preprocess/preprocess9.png">
        <br><br><br><br>The cost for two people contained ',' for indicating thousands in denomination. This
        column
        turned out to be a string column.
        I wrote a function which removes the ',' and converts the column value into a nteger type of value.
        I chose integer type specifically because the restarants menu cost were in rounded values rather
        than fractions. Besides no one pays in paises. <br>
        <img src="/static/images/preprocess/preprocess10.png"><br>
        The Dishes liked by people contained a lot of null values. So I had to remove those. To do this I
        made the following function.
        I simply checked if the column had null, took that into a separate array and if any value was
        similar to the values in this array
        I replaced it with 'Not rated item.'
        <br><img src="/static/images/preprocess/preprocess11.png">
        <br><img src="/static/images/preprocess/preprocess12.png">
        <br>Reviews column was another major data which actully describes the users experience as well as
        Restaurant's performance.
        This column was an object column with text data. To clean all the text data, I implemented the
        following loop.
        Function Looks complicated, but is very simple. Its just removing unwanted characters including
        symbols, phone numbers, emails, urls, digits, currency symbols,
        puntuations, new line entries, also every review came with '\rated', which was unrequired. I did try
        function to implement this logic, but it was exahustive and consumed a lot of RAM and time.
        <br><img src="/static/images/preprocess/preprocess13.png">
        <br>Later I saved the file as most of the required columns were cleanned. I did not want to alter
        the address, url, phone_number column <br>
        <img src="/static/images/preprocess/preprocess14.png">
